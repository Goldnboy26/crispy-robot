During the project, I started by looking at what was missing and started to add everything making sure there was no mistakes at the time to link the images
from my assets folder, so then as I uploaded everything then it would run perfect. at the time to upload my stuff to Github it was a big challenge but then
I understood that it needed to also match with my local rep, so then it was just a matter of having everything match.
